## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported data from **AdventureWorks.xlsx**.  
- Cleaned and transformed tables in **Power Query**:
  - Removed irrelevant fields, Handled null values.  
  - Created additional calculated columns (e.g., Age Groups).  
- Built a **data model in Power Pivot** by connecting fact and dimension tables:  
  - `FactInternetSales`, `DimProduct`, `DimCustomer`, `DimDate`, `DimSalesTerritory`, `DimGeography`.  
- Structured the model using a **Star Schema** approach for efficient analysis.  

### 2. Dashboard Design
Two dashboards were designed inside Excel with a focus on clarity, interactivity, and actionable insights.  

#### üìå Page 1: Time Series Dashboard
- **KPIs**:  
  - Total Quantity, Total Cost, Total Revenue, Total Profit, Profit Margin, Number of Transactions.  
  - Each KPI includes a year-over-year comparison (% increase/decrease).  

- **Visualizations & Insights**:  
  - Clustered Column Chart: Total Profit, Revenue, and Transactions across years (2005‚Äì2008).  
  - Line chart: Total Profit over months (trend analysis).  
  - Clustered Column Chart: Total Profit by weekday.  
  - Pie chart: Total Profit split between weekdays and weekends.  
  - Custom chart: Total Profit by quarter.

- **Filters**: Year, Country, Month.
